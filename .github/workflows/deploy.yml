name: Jira Deploy Test (dummy deployment for Jira)

# Purpose: Create real GitHub Deployment events (pending -> success)
# so Jira Cloud (with Atlassian for GitHub installed) can display them in
# the Jira "Deployments" panel. This workflow performs NO real external
# deployment when run with `test_only=true` (default for manual runs).

  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:
    # Optional inputs when run manually
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Deployment environment (e.g. production, staging, review)'
        required: false
        default: 'production'
      ref:
        description: 'Ref to deploy (branch, tag, or SHA). Defaults to the commit that triggered the run.'
        required: false
      test_only:
        description: 'If true, mark deployment successful without doing the actual deployment (default true)'
        required: false
        default: 'true'

# Notes:
# - Run manually from Actions → "Jira Deploy Test" or with the CLI:
#     gh workflow run deploy.yml --ref main -f environment=staging -f test_only=true
# - If you need the deployment events to trigger other workflows, consider
#   using a PAT (personal access token) with sufficient permissions instead
#   of the default GITHUB_TOKEN (GitHub's GITHUB_TOKEN won't trigger other workflows in some cases).
# - The `environment-url` is set to https://example.com so platforms like Jira
#   can display a link to the deployed environment.
