name: Jira Deploy Test (dummy deployment for Jira)

# This workflow creates GitHub Deployment events (pending → success) so
# that Jira Cloud (with the Atlassian for GitHub app installed) can show
# deployments in the Jira Deployments panel. It performs no real server-side
# deployment when `test_only` is true (default for manual runs).

# Notes:
# - This workflow is safe for testing Jira's "Deployments" panel because it
#   creates real GitHub Deployment events and marks them successful.
# - Run manually from Actions → Jira Deploy Test or via the CLI:
#   `gh workflow run deploy.yml -f environment=staging -f test_only=true`
# - If you need the deployment events to trigger other workflows, consider
#   using a personal access token with the right permissions instead of
#   the default GITHUB_TOKEN (see GitHub docs).
